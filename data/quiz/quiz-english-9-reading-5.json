      "question": "Read the passage:\n\n'Bioluminescence, the production and emission of light by a living organism, is a phenomenon primarily observed in marine vertebrates and invertebrates. While often perceived merely as an aesthetic marvel, this chemical reaction serves critical evolutionary functions, including camouflage (counter-illumination), mimicry, and predation. For instance, the anglerfish utilizes a bioluminescent lure to attract unsuspecting prey in the pitch-black depths of the ocean.'\n\nQuestion: What is the primary purpose of the text?",
      "options": ["To describe the beauty of the ocean", "To explain the functions of bioluminescence beyond its appearance", "To list all animals that can produce light", "To argue against deep-sea exploration"],
      "correctAnswer": "To explain the functions of bioluminescence beyond its appearance",
      "level": "hard",
      "explanation": "The text moves from defining the term to explaining its 'critical evolutionary functions' like camouflage and predation."

      "question": "Read the passage:\n\n'The concept of geoengineering—deliberate, large-scale intervention in the Earth’s natural systems to counteract climate change—remains highly controversial. Proponents argue it may be a necessary last resort if emission cuts fail. However, critics warn of unintended consequences, such as altering monsoon patterns or damaging the ozone layer, which could exacerbate the very problems we seek to solve.'\n\nQuestion: Why do critics oppose geoengineering?",
      "options": ["It is too expensive to implement", "It requires too much manpower", "It might cause unforeseen negative effects on the environment", "It has already been proven to be ineffective"],
      "correctAnswer": "It might cause unforeseen negative effects on the environment",
      "level": "hard",
      "explanation": "Critics warn of 'unintended consequences' like altering monsoons or damaging the ozone layer."

      "question": "Read the conversation:\n\nScientist A: 'The data on the new alloy’s tensile strength is promising, but the thermal conductivity is suboptimal for aerospace applications.'\nScientist B: 'Agreed. If we can't enhance its heat dissipation properties, it will be structurally compromised upon re-entry.'\nScientist A: 'Perhaps doping it with graphene could mitigate the issue without adding significant weight.'\n\nQuestion: What is the problem with the new alloy?",
      "options": ["It is too heavy", "It is not strong enough", "It does not release heat well enough", "It is too expensive to produce"],
      "correctAnswer": "It does not release heat well enough",
      "level": "hard",
      "explanation": "'Thermal conductivity is suboptimal' and 'heat dissipation' issues mean it doesn't handle/release heat well."

      "question": "Read the passage:\n\n'Cryptocurrencies utilize blockchain technology, a decentralized ledger system that records transactions across many computers so that the record cannot be altered retroactively without the alteration of all subsequent blocks and the consensus of the network. This immutability is the cornerstone of its security, yet the anonymity it provides has raised concerns regarding illicit financial activities.'\n\nQuestion: What feature of blockchain ensures its security?",
      "options": ["Its anonymity", "Its speed of transaction", "Its immutability (inability to be changed)", "Its low cost"],
      "correctAnswer": "Its immutability (inability to be changed)",
      "level": "hard",
      "explanation": "The text states: 'This immutability is the cornerstone of its security'."

      "question": "Read the passage:\n\n'Symbiosis describes a close and long-term biological interaction between two different biological organisms. While mutualism benefits both parties, parasitism benefits one at the expense of the other. Commensalism, often the most misunderstood, involves one organism benefiting while the other is neither helped nor harmed.'\n\nQuestion: Which relationship is described as 'Commensalism'?",
      "options": ["Both organisms benefit", "One benefits, the other is harmed", "One benefits, the other is unaffected", "Both organisms are harmed"],
      "correctAnswer": "One benefits, the other is unaffected",
      "level": "hard",
      "explanation": "The text defines commensalism as: 'one organism benefiting while the other is neither helped nor harmed'."
