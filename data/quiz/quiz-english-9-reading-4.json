      "question": "Read the excerpt:\n\n'The old manor stood on the hill, a silent sentinel overlooking the valley. Its windows, like hollow eyes, seemed to stare blankly at the encroaching forest. For years, the villagers had woven tales of spectral lights and mournful wails emanating from within, yet no soul dared confirm these rumors firsthand. The isolation was self-imposed; the house repelled visitors not with gates, but with an air of palpable sorrow.'\n\nQuestion: What does the phrase 'silent sentinel' suggest about the house?",
      "options": ["It was noisy and active", "It was watching over the valley like a guard", "It was abandoned and invisible", "It was a military fortress"],
      "correctAnswer": "It was watching over the valley like a guard",
      "level": "hard",
      "explanation": "'Sentinel' means a guard or soldier whose job is to stand and keep watch. The metaphor suggests the house is watching the valley."

      "question": "Read the excerpt:\n\n'Elara’s decision to leave was not born of malice, but of a desperate need for self-preservation. The city, with its relentless cacophony and towering ambition, was slowly suffocating her artistic spirit.

      "level": "hard",
      "explanation": "This is a metaphor. Just as plants need light to photosynthesize and grow, Elara needed a different environment to thrive artistically."

      "question": "Read the passage:\n\n'Nostalgia is a deceptive lens. It softens the jagged edges of the past, rendering painful memories into bittersweet lessons and ordinary days into golden eras. When we look back, we are not seeing history as it was, but as we wish it to be. This revisionist history can be dangerous if it prevents us from appreciating the progress of the present.'\n\nQuestion: According to the author, what is a danger of nostalgia?",

      "level": "hard",
      "explanation": "The text says it is a 'deceptive lens' and can be dangerous if it 'prevents us from appreciating the progress of the present'."
