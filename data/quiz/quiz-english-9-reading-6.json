      "question": "Read the passage:\n\n'The Industrial Revolution was a double-edged sword for 19th-century society. While it heralded an era of unprecedented technological advancement and mass production, it simultaneously dismantled the traditional social fabric. Urbanization led to overcrowding, and the shift from agrarian labor to factory work resulted in the commodification of time, where the sun no longer dictated the workday, but the clock did.'\n\nQuestion: What is meant by the 'commodification of time'?",
      "options": ["Time became unlimited for everyone", "Time became a resource to be measured, bought, and sold", "People stopped using clocks", "Farmers worked longer hours than factory workers"],
      "correctAnswer": "Time became a resource to be measured, bought, and sold",
      "level": "hard",
      "explanation": "Commodification means treating something as a product. The text contrasts the sun (natural time) with the clock (measured/sold time in factories)."

      "question": "Read the conversation:\n\nInterviewer: 'Do you believe Artificial Intelligence signals the end of human creativity?'\nArtist: 'Not the end, but a transformation. The camera didn't kill painting; it forced painting to become more abstract, to capture what a lens could not. AI will likely force writers and artists to explore the deeply human nuances—empathy, vulnerability, and chaos—that algorithms struggle to replicate.'\n\nQuestion: How does the artist view the impact of AI on art?",
      "options": ["It will completely destroy human art", "It will replace all artists immediately", "It will push artists to focus on uniquely human qualities", "It will have no impact whatsoever"],
      "correctAnswer": "It will push artists to focus on uniquely human qualities",
      "level": "hard",
      "explanation": "The artist says AI will 'force writers and artists to explore the deeply human nuances... that algorithms struggle to replicate'."

      "question": "Read the passage:\n\n'Globalization has undoubtedly facilitated the cross-pollination of cultures, leading to a more interconnected world. However, sociologists worry about the phenomenon of \"cultural homogenization,\" where local traditions and languages are eroded by dominant global influences, potentially leading to a monoculture where distinct identities are lost.'\n\nQuestion: What is the negative aspect of globalization mentioned?",
      "options": ["It prevents people from traveling", "It leads to more wars", "It may cause the loss of unique local cultures and identities", "It makes economies weaker"],
      "correctAnswer": "It may cause the loss of unique local cultures and identities",
      "level": "hard",
      "explanation": "The text warns of 'cultural homogenization' where 'local traditions... are eroded'."

      "id": 4,
      "question": "Read the passage:\n\n'To say that history repeats itself is a cliché that ignores the nuances of context. It is more accurate to say that history rhymes. Patterns of human behavior—greed, ambition, fear—remain constant, but the variables of technology, geography, and ideology shift. Thus, predicting the future based solely on the past is a folly, yet ignoring the past is suicide.'\n\nQuestion: What is the author's argument regarding history?",
      "options": ["History repeats itself exactly", "We should ignore the past because it is different", "Similar patterns occur, but the context changes", "We can perfectly predict the future using history"],
      "correctAnswer": "Similar patterns occur, but the context changes",
      "level": "hard",
      "explanation": "The author says 'history rhymes' (similar patterns) but 'variables... shift' (context changes)."

      "question": "Read the conversation:\n\nTeacher: 'The protagonist in this novel is often described as a \"Byronic Hero\". What traits support this?'\nStudent: 'Well, he is intelligent and sophisticated, but also brooding, cynical, and essentially an outcast. He rejects social norms and seems to be fighting an internal battle, which makes him charismatic but dangerous.'\n\nQuestion: Which description best fits a 'Byronic Hero' based on the student's answer?",
      "options": ["A happy, lucky, and socially loved leader", "A brave warrior who follows all the rules", "A flawed, moody, rebellious, but fascinating character", "A villain who has no good qualities"],
      "correctAnswer": "A flawed, moody, rebellious, but fascinating character",
      "level": "hard",
      "explanation": "The student uses words like 'brooding', 'cynical', 'outcast', 'rejects social norms', and 'charismatic'."
